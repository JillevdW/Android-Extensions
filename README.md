# ðŸ¦† Android Extensions

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

While working on projects I often stop and think: "I might need this later." Whenever that happens, I try to turn that particular piece of code into an Extension. This repo will be a place to store them all.

## ðŸš€ [Extension+AnimatorSet](https://github.com/JillevdW/Android-Extensions/blob/master/Extension+AnimatorSet/README.md)
An extension to the AnimatorSet class to execute functions at specific points in an animation.


## ðŸ¤¯ [Extension+didSet](https://github.com/JillevdW/Android-Extensions/blob/master/Extension+didSet/README.md)
This extension adds the `didSet` and `willSet` properties as they are used in Swift to Kotlin.
